 <h1>The Best Movies According to Sue</h1>
 <h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>You've Got Mail</h3>
 <p>This movie starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan brings together a cast of interesting characters in a Rom Com about two people who have an online relationship, but unbeknownst to them, they actually know each other in real life. I enjoy this movie because these are two of my facorite actors.  Since the story revolves around the early years of the internet and online dating, it had me hooked even before it started.</p>
 <h3>A Christmas Wish</h3>
 <p>This movie starring Debbie Reynolds and Neil Patrick Harris is a Christmas movie about a grandson that returns home to settle his grandfathers affairs.  At the request of his grandmother he trys to untangle the mystery of a woman named Lillian who she discovered after grandpas journals. I enjoy the genuine feel among the actors and the surprise twist once they find Lillian.</p>
<h3>National Treasure</h3>
 <p>This movie starring Nicholas Cage is an intriging history lesson wrapped up in a mystery.</p>
